## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Sources (Priority Order):
1. **Primary**: `useVehicleOils` hook - Fetches from vehicle oils API
2. **Secondary**: `technicalData.lubricants` - From SWS technical data integration
3. **Fallback**: "N/A" when no data is available

### Key Components:
- **File**: `components/job-sheet/clean-job-sheet-form.tsx`
- **Hook**: `useVehicleOils` (imported from `@/hooks/use-vehicle-oils`)
- **Data Interface**: `VehicleOilData` (from `app/api/vehicle-oils/route.ts`)

### Oil Type Logic:
The system intelligently determines oil type based on viscosity:
- **0W-XX, 5W-XX**: Synthetic
- **10W-XX**: Semi-Synthetic  
- **15W-XX, 20W-XX**: Mineral
- **Plus specification analysis**: Checks for "synthetic" keywords in specification

### Capacity Formatting:
- Automatically formats numbers with "Litres" suffix
- Handles both numeric and string capacity values
- Preserves existing unit formatting when present

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Automatic Loading:
1. **Vehicle Registration Lookup** → Triggers oil data fetch
2. **VIN Detection** → Fetches oil specifications using VIN
3. **Database Cache** → Checks for existing oil data first
4. **API Fallback** → Fetches fresh data if not cached
5. **Display Update** → Shows oil information in real-time

### Loading States:
- **Loading**: Shows "Loading..." text in blue
- **Error**: Displays error message with warning icon
- **Success**: Shows formatted oil specifications
- **No Data**: Shows "N/A" for missing information

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Styling:
- **Section Header**: "OIL SPECIFICATIONS" in uppercase, gray text
- **Labels**: Small, semibold, gray text with tracking
- **Values**: Large, bold, dark gray text for visibility
- **Loading**: Blue text to indicate active state
- **Errors**: Red text with warning icon

### Responsive Layout:
- **Desktop**: 2-column grid (Oil Type | Oil Capacity)
- **Mobile**: Stacks vertically for better readability
- **Consistent**: Matches existing vehicle information styling

## 📊 Additional Information

### Extended Details (When Available):
- **Oil Specification**: Technical specification (e.g., "ACEA A3/B4")
- **Change Interval**: Service interval (e.g., "10k miles")
- **Loading Indicators**: Real-time feedback during data fetch

### Integration Points:
- **Job Sheet Form**: Main display location
- **Vehicle Lookup**: Triggers oil data fetch
- **Technical Data Modal**: Additional detailed view
- **Parts Integration**: Oil can be added as parts to job

## 🔍 Testing & Verification

### Test Scenarios:
1. **New Vehicle**: Enter registration → Oil specs should load
2. **Existing Vehicle**: Load saved job → Oil specs from database
3. **No Data**: Invalid VIN → Should show "N/A"
4. **Loading State**: During fetch → Should show loading indicators
5. **Error Handling**: API failure → Should show error message

### Expected Behavior:
- Oil information appears within 2-3 seconds of vehicle lookup
- Data persists when job sheet is saved and reloaded
- Fallback to "N/A" when no oil data is available
- Loading states provide clear user feedback

## 🚀 Enhanced Oil Service Actions

- **Total**: Complete oil change service package

#### 3. **Add Oil as Part Only**
- **Parts**: Adds only the oil as a line item
- **No Labour**: For when customer supplies labour or DIY
- **Flexible**: Technician can add custom labour separately

### 📝 Automatic Description Generation:

The system automatically writes professional job descriptions:
- **Top-Up**: "TOP UP ENGINE OIL WITH 5W-30 SYNTHETIC X 4 LITRES"
- **Change**: "ENGINE OIL AND FILTER CHANGE WITH 5W-30 SYNTHETIC X 5 LITRES"
- **Appends**: Adds to existing descriptions without overwriting
- **Uppercase**: Professional formatting for consistency

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Create Public Issues

Please do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### 2. Contact Us Privately

Send an email to: security@garagemanagement.com (or create a private issue)

Include the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: Within 7 days
  - High: Within 14 days
  - Medium: Within 30 days
  - Low: Next scheduled release

### 4. Disclosure Policy

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- We will investigate and validate the issue
- We will develop and test a fix
- We will release the fix and publicly disclose the vulnerability
- We will credit you for the discovery (if desired)

## Security Measures

### Current Security Features

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- CORS configuration for API security
- Error handling without information disclosure
- Secure database connection handling

### Planned Security Enhancements

- User authentication and authorization
- API key management
- Rate limiting
- Session management
- Audit logging
- Data encryption at rest
- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers implementation

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**

   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Sanitize data before display

2. **Error Handling**

   - Don't expose sensitive information in errors
   - Log security events
   - Use generic error messages for users

3. **Database Security**

   - Use least privilege principle
   - Regular security updates
   - Backup encryption

4. **Code Review**
   - Review all code changes
   - Use static analysis tools
   - Follow secure coding guidelines

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Security**

   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Secure server configuration
   - Regular security updates
   - Firewall configuration

2. **Access Control**

   - Implement authentication
   - Use role-based permissions
   - Regular access reviews

3. **Monitoring**
   - Log security events
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **No Authentication**: Current version has no user authentication
2. **No Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are not rate limited
3. **No Encryption**: Database is not encrypted at rest
4. **No Audit Trail**: No logging of user actions

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Network Security**: Deploy behind firewall/VPN
2. **Access Control**: Limit network access to trusted users
3. **Regular Backups**: Implement secure backup strategy
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor application logs for anomalies

## Vulnerability Categories

### High Priority

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Authentication bypass
- Authorization flaws
- Remote code execution

### Medium Priority

- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Session management issues

### Low Priority

- Information leakage
- Weak cryptography
- Configuration issues

## Security Testing

### Recommended Testing

1. **Static Analysis**

   - Use tools like Bandit for Python
   - Code review for security issues

2. **Dynamic Testing**

   - Penetration testing
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - API security testing

3. **Dependency Scanning**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Vulnerability scanning of dependencies

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident

1. **Immediate Response**

   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Contain the incident
   - Preserve evidence

2. **Investigation**

   - Determine root cause
   - Assess data impact
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**

   - Implement fixes
   - Restore services
   - Monitor for recurrence

4. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Provide status updates
   - Document lessons learned

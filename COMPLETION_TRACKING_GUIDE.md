# üìã MOT Reminder Completion Tracking System

## Overview
The MOT Reminder system now includes a comprehensive completion tracking feature that allows garage staff to mark vehicles as "processed" or "verified" after they have been reviewed or contacted. This helps prevent duplicate work and provides clear visibility into what still requires attention.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. **Visual Status Indicators**
- **Completion Checkboxes**: Each vehicle has a green checkbox next to the registration number
- **Strikethrough Effect**: Completed vehicles show registration with strikethrough text
- **Opacity Reduction**: Completed rows are visually dimmed (70% opacity)
- **Verification Badges**: "Verified" badge appears in the status column for completed vehicles
- **Row Highlighting**: Completed vehicles have a light gray background

### 2. **Persistent State Management**
- **localStorage Integration**: Completion status is automatically saved to browser storage
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Status persists across browser sessions and page refreshes
- **Automatic Loading**: System loads saved completion status on page initialization
- **Real-time Saving**: Changes are immediately saved when toggled

### 3. **Bulk Actions**
- **Mark as Completed**: Select multiple vehicles and mark them all as completed at once
- **Mark as Pending**: Reset completion status for selected vehicles

### 4. **Status Filtering**

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### Typical Usage Pattern
1. **Load MOT Reminders**: System shows all vehicles with current MOT status
